### Introduction

In the VRHumansandSystems project, our team implemented four distinct illusions in virtual reality:

- Optical Illusion
- Moon Illusion
- Ponzo Illusion
- Ebbinghaus Illusion.

#### Optical Illusion

This scene is based on Chromatic Adaptation. The outline of an object is presented in VR using two contrasting colors, creating an optical illusion. Users are instructed to focus on a black dot in the middle for a period, after which the real object with its distinct features is revealed, resulting in a trace of both previously presented colors.

#### Moon Illusion

Exploring the moon illusion phenomenon experienced in everyday life, this VR setting presents two moons in the sky. One moon appears near the horizon line, and the other higher in the sky. Despite being of the same size, the moon intersecting with the horizontal line appears larger due to the moon illusion.

#### Ponzo Illusion

A visual illusion demonstrating how the perception of the size of an object is influenced by its background. Placing two similar objects on converging lines illustrates how depth cues and contextual visual information affect our perception of size.

#### Ebbinghaus Illusion

This illusion involves two central spheres surrounded by differently sized spheres. The surrounding spheres create the illusion that both central spheres are different in size, playing with our perception of relative size in VR.

### Requirements

In order to run this experiment, you must have:

<!-- - Unity3d -->

- Virtual Realtiy equipment like Oculus Quest 2

### Run instruction

1. Clone this project:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/manhhungking/VR_Humans_And_Systems.git
   ```

2. Connect your Quest 2 device with your computer by following this instruction:

3. There are 4 folders related to 4 different illusions, and each folder has .exe file that will run the corresponding experiment:

   Run and experience yourself. Have fun!
